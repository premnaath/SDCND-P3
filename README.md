# READ ME - Self-driving cars Engineer Nanodegree - P3

## Purpose of this repo

This repo was created to hold all files related to project 3 of SDCND by Udacity.

### Project description in brief
In this project, you will use what you've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. You will train, validate and test a model using Keras. The model will output a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.

We have provided a simulator where you can steer a car around a track for data collection. You'll use image data and steering angles to train a neural network and then use this model to drive the car autonomously around the track.

We also want you to create a detailed writeup of the project. Check out the writeup template for this project and use it as a starting point for creating your own writeup. The writeup can be either a markdown file or a pdf document.

## Contents of this repo
To meet specifications, the project requires submitting five files:

images (folder containing images for documentation)
model.py (script used to create and train the model)
drive.py (script to drive the car - feel free to modify this file)
model.h5 (a trained Keras model)
writeup_report.md a report writeup file (either markdown or pdf)
video.mp4 (a video recording of your vehicle driving autonomously around the track for at least one full lap)
